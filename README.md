## What is witnessd?

**witnessd** creates tamper-evident cryptographic records of document authorship. It provides irrefutable proof that you wrote what you wrote, when you wrote it.

- **Prove authorship** — Cryptographic evidence chain linking you to your work
- **Detect AI content** — Forensic analysis identifies non-human writing patterns
- **Hardware-backed** — TPM 2.0 integration for device binding
- **Verify independently** — Evidence can be verified by anyone, anywhere
